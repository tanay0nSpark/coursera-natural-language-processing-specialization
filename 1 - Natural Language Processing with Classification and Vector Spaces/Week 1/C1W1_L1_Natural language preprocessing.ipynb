        "All these words are stemmed from its common root **learn**. However, in some cases, the stemming process produces words that are not correct spellings of the root word. For example, **happi** and **sunni**. That's because it chooses the most common stem for related words. For example, we can look at the set of words that comprises the different forms of happy:\n",
